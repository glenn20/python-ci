name: Tests

#   A reusable github workflow to run code checks and CI pytest workflows on the
#   codebase, including
#   - `mypy` for type checks,
#   - `ruff check` for linting, and
#   - `ruff format` for code formatting.
#   - `pytest` for running tests.
#
#   Accepts the following inputs:
#   - `os`: A json string containing the list of operating systems on which to
#     run tests.
#     Default is `["ubuntu-latest", "windows-latest", "macos-latest"]`.
#   - `python-version`: A json string containing the list of python versions on
#     which to run tests.
#     Default is `["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]`.
#
#   Uses `uv run` to run the checks and tests.
