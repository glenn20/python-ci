name: CI using tox

#   A reusable github workflow to run python CI workflows, including static code
#   checks, automated testing (using pytest or tox), package building,
#   publishing to test.pypi.org and pypi.org, and creating a GitHub release.
#
#   The workflow elements to selected are specified in the `jobs` input. The
#   default is to run the `test-tox` and `build` jobs. The CI workflow is
#   configured in the tox-gh config (eg. pyproject.toml). See
#   https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-gh.
#
#   Accepts the following inputs:
#   - `jobs`: A json string containing the list of jobs to run. Default is
#     `["test-tox", "build"]`. The available jobs are:
#     - `code-check`: Run static code checks (using `mypy`, `ruff`, etc.).
#     - `test-pytest`: Run tests using `pytest`.
#     - `test-tox`: Run tests and code checks using `tox` (alias "test").
#     - `build`: Build the python package.
#     - `publish-test`: Publish the package to test.pypi.org.
#     - `publish`: Publish the package to pypi.org.
#     - `release`: Create a GitHub release.
#   - `os`: A json string containing the list of operating systems on which to
#     run tests. Default is `["ubuntu-latest", "windows-latest",
#     "macos-latest"]`.
#   - `python-version`: A json string containing the list of python versions on
#     which to run tests. Default is `["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]`.
#
#   Assumes the configurations for all tools (`mypy`, `uv`, `ruff`, `pytest`,
#   ...) are fully specified in config files (eg `pyproject.toml`).
#
#   You should select either `test-tox` or `code-check`+`test-pytest`, but not
#   both.
#
#   It is recommended to use the `test-tox` job, as it includes the code checks,
#   and can be more easily customised in yourq pyproject.toml so that the same CI
#   process runs on your local computer and on github.
#
#   All workflows use astral `uv` to execute actions wherever possible.
